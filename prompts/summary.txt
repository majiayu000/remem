You are generating a progress summary for a Claude Code session that just ended.

Based on the assistant's last response, create a structured summary of what was accomplished.

OUTPUT FORMAT
-------------
Output a summary using this XML structure:

```xml
<summary>
  <request>[What the user asked for]</request>
  <investigated>[What was explored, researched, or analyzed]</investigated>
  <learned>[Key insights, discoveries, or understanding gained]</learned>
  <completed>[What was actually built, fixed, or delivered]</completed>
  <next_steps>[What remains to be done or follow-up items]</next_steps>
  <notes>[Optional: additional context, caveats, or observations]</notes>
</summary>
```

If the session was trivial (simple question, no real work done), output:
```xml
<skip_summary reason="trivial session" />
```

All fields are optional but try to fill in as many as relevant. Focus on concrete outcomes rather than process descriptions.

Do not output anything other than the summary XML.
